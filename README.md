# Rayshader_animation

Testing some of the capabilties of R package [Rayshader](https://github.com/tylermorganwall/rayshader)
Alternate processing and lighting of LiDAR elevation models is key to revealing the 'geologic structure' of the landscape.
With multiple lighting directions and lighting styles landscape scale fracture patterns and glacial grooves, along with bedrock outcrops or places where bedrock is near the surface are often more easily located.

### Example 
Rotating rayshade and sphereshade "sun" azimuth
